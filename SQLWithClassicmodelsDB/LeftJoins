-- SQL Left Join Guide

-- Introduction to Left Joins:
-- Left Join is a type of join in SQL that returns all records from the left table (table1) and the matched records from the right table (table2). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

-- When to Use Left Joins:

-- 1. When you need to include all records from the left table, regardless of whether there is a matching record in the right table.
-- 2. When you want to find records in the left table that do not have a corresponding match in the right table.

-- Additional Information:

-- 1. Preserves Data Integrity:
-- Left joins help preserve data integrity by ensuring that all records from the left table are included in the result set, even if there are no matching records in the right table.

-- 2. Handling Missing Data:
-- Left joins are useful for identifying missing or incomplete data in the right table. When NULL values are returned for columns from the right table, it indicates that there is no corresponding match in the right table.

-- 3. Useful for Analysis and Reporting:
-- Left joins are commonly used in analysis and reporting scenarios where it's important to include all records from the primary table (left table) and supplement them with additional information from the related table (right table), if available.

-- Syntax:
-- SELECT column1, column2, ...
-- FROM table1
-- LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-- Example:
-- Suppose we have two tables: customers and orders.
-- We want to retrieve all customers along with their corresponding orders, if any.

-- SQL Query Syntax:
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

-- List all customers and their orders (if any)
SELECT customers.customerName, orders.orderNumber
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customerNumber = orders.customerNumber;

-- Description:
-- This SQL query retrieves a list of all customers and their corresponding orders (if any). It achieves this by performing a left join between the customers table (left table) and the orders table (right table) based on the customerNumber column, which serves as the common key between the two tables.
-- The LEFT JOIN keyword ensures that all records from the customers table are included in the result set, regardless of whether there is a matching record in the orders table. This means that even customers who haven't placed any orders will still appear in the output.
-- When a customer has no corresponding orders, NULL values are returned for the order-related columns from the orders table. This indicates that the customer has not placed any orders.

-- Conclusion:
-- Left joins are powerful tools for combining data from two or more tables while preserving all records from the primary table (left table). They are useful for scenarios where you need to include all records from the left table and supplement them with additional information from the related table, if available.
