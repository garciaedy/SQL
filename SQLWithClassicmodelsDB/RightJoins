-- SQL Right Join Guide

-- Introduction to Right Joins:
-- Right Join is a type of join in SQL that returns all records from the right table (table2) and the matched records from the left table (table1). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

-- When to Use Right Joins:

-- 1. When you need to include all records from the right table, regardless of whether there is a matching record in the left table.
-- 2. When you want to find records in the right table that do not have a corresponding match in the left table.

-- Additional Information:

-- 1. Preserve All Records from Right Table:
-- Use a right join when you need to retrieve all records from the right table and only the matching records from the left table.

-- 2. Find Missing Matches:
-- Right joins are useful for identifying records in the right table that do not have corresponding records in the left table.

-- 3. Default Values:
-- Right joins can be used to ensure that certain default values from the right table are always included, regardless of the presence of related records in the left table.

-- Syntax:
-- SELECT columns
-- FROM table1
-- RIGHT JOIN table2
-- ON table1.column = table2.column;

-- How to Identify When to Use Right Joins:

-- 1. Preserve All Records from Right Table:
-- Use a right join when you need to retrieve all records from the right table and only the matching records from the left table.

-- 2. Find Missing Matches:
-- Useful for identifying records in the right table that do not have corresponding records in the left table.

-- Examples of Right Joins with Explanations:

-- Syntax
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;

-- Example 1: List all orders and their customers (if any)
SELECT customers.customerName, orders.orderNumber, orders.orderDate
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders ON customers.customerNumber = orders.customerNumber;

-- Description:
-- This SQL query retrieves a list of all orders and their corresponding customers (if any). It achieves this by performing a right join between the customers table (left table) and the orders table (right table) based on the customerNumber column, which serves as the common key between the two tables.
-- The RIGHT JOIN keyword ensures that all records from the orders table are included in the result set, regardless of whether there is a matching record in the customers table. This means that even orders without corresponding customers will still appear in the output.
-- When an order has no corresponding customer, NULL values are returned for the customer-related columns from the customers table. This indicates that the customer information is missing for that particular order.

-- Conclusion:
-- Right joins are valuable tools for combining data from two or more tables while ensuring that all records from the right table are included in the result set. They are useful for scenarios where you need to include all records from the right table and supplement them with additional information from the related table, if available.
