-- SQL Inner Join Guide

-- Introduction:
-- Inner joins are one of the fundamental concepts in SQL used for combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. 
-- Inner joins retrieve only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined.

-- When to Use Inner Joins:
-- 1. Use inner joins when you want to retrieve only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
-- 2. When you need to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.
-- Mandatory Relationships:
-- Use an inner join when both tables must have related data. For instance, when querying orders and their details, both the order and the details must exist.

-- Syntax:
-- SELECT column1, column2, ...
-- FROM table1
-- INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

-- Example:
-- Suppose we have two tables: employees and departments.
-- We want to retrieve the names of employees along with their corresponding department names.

-- SQL Query:
-- Example: List all orders with customer information
SELECT orders.orderNumber, customers.customerName, orders.orderDate
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customerNumber = customers.customerNumber;


-- Description:
-- In this example, we are performing an inner join between the employees table and the departments table based on the department_id column, which is common in both tables.
-- The INNER JOIN keyword ensures that only the rows with matching department_id values from both tables are included in the result set.
-- We select the employee_id and employee_name columns from the employees table and the department_name column from the departments table.

-- Additional Information:
-- 1. Inner joins are typically used when there is a relationship between the columns in the tables being joined, such as a foreign key-primary key relationship.
-- 2. If there are no matching rows between the tables being joined, the inner join will return an empty result set.
-- 3. Inner joins can be chained together to join more than two tables.
-- 4. It's important to alias the table names to make the SQL query more readable, especially when dealing with multiple tables.

-- Reporting:
-- Inner joins are often used in reporting to combine related data from multiple tables, ensuring completeness and relevance.


-- Conclusion:
-- Inner joins are powerful tools for combining data from multiple tables based on related columns. They allow you to retrieve only the rows that have matching values in both tables, facilitating efficient data retrieval and analysis.
